# 🖥️ Frontend - CharacterHub Assignment

🔗 **Live Demo**: [Frontend Deployed Link](https://character-hub-assessment.vercel.app/)  

This frontend was created as part of the **CharacterHub SDE Assignment Round**. The task involved building a **frontend and backend separately** to demonstrate full-stack capabilities. As instructed, the entire project was built **within 1 hour**.

The frontend is developed using **Vue.js**, with a clean, modular, and mobile-responsive design. It interacts seamlessly with the backend via REST APIs.
